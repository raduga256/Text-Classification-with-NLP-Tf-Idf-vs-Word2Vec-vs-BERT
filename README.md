## Kaggle Data Source
I will use the “News category dataset” in which you are provided with news headlines from the year 2012 to 2018 obtained from HuffPost and you are asked to classify them with the right category, therefore this is a multiclass classification problem.

## Context
This dataset contains around 200k news headlines from the year 2012 to 2018 obtained from HuffPost. The model trained on this dataset could be used to identify tags for untracked news articles or to identify the type of language used in different news articles.

Each news headline has a corresponding category. Categories and corresponding article counts are as follows:
